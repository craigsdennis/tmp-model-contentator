# FrontMatter builder for Model Pages

This is a temporary script to turn Models into Front Matter pages for the docs.

Currently just writing to `/tmp` will integrate if this is a good idea.


## Installation

Copy [.env.example](./.env.example) to `.env` and make the changes necessary.

```bash
npm install
```

## Generate

```bash
npm run docs
```

## TODO

- [ ] Write the actual files
- [ ] Determine if we can make partials optional
